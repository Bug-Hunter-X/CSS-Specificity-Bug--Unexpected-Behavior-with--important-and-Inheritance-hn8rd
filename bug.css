The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

Applying these styles to elements results in unexpected behavior due to the interaction of `!important`, inheritance, and specificity. The unexpected behavior might not be immediately apparent to developers unfamiliar with the intricacies of CSS specificity and the `!important` declaration.
