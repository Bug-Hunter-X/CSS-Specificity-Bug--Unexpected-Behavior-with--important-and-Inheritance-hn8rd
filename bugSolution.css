The solution involves refactoring the CSS to avoid unnecessary use of `!important` and ensure clear style prioritization.  Specificity is managed through a more organized and predictable approach:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green; 
}

.child {
  color: red; /* Removed !important */
}
```

This revised CSS code leverages specificity rules effectively without relying on `!important`, resulting in the expected behavior and improved code maintainability.
